This week I added the basis and a couple of unit tests for the AI functionality. I also divided the project into separate directories.
I studied the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms more thoroughly and learned how they're best utilized in my project.
One thing I have wondered is how widely I'm supposed to test functions.
Is it enough to test the AI or do I have to add tests for e.g. the UI?
I didn't have time to add codecov or a coverage report, so I'll look into them next week. 
I'll also start implementing the algorithms to the AI next week.
