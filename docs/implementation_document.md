
The program is divided into four python files. Connect4_ai.py has the AI's functionality i.e. the implementation of the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
Connect4_ui.py has the user interface and the pygame loop. Connect4_utils.py has some of the functionality that several files use.
Constants.py has all constants. The game is executed through connect4.py.

The gameplay doesn't allow the player yet to choose the AI's difficulty i.e. the depth of the minimax algorithm calls.
This could be a future feature. Also, the heuristic scoring system may be flawed and hasn't yet been tested well enough to give the best results.

ChatGPT or any other language models have not been used during development.
