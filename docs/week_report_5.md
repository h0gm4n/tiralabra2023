This week I wrote the first peer review. I corrected the implementation document's info on time complexity.\
I was also planning to fix some issues based on the peer review but as of Friday I have not received one.

Next week I'll try looking into the iterative deepening and fixing any problems given in the (possible) peer review.

Time used this week: 2h
