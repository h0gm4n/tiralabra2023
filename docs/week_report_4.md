This week I started writing the implementation document and started testing the AI's time complexity. \
I manually timed the speed of the AI with different game cases and tree depths. I modified the testing document.
I wrote the user manual. 

I would appreciate a few tips for making more versatile tests. There were several useful tips given at the lecture but I can't \
recall the specifics of them.

Next week I'll add more tests if necessary.
