This week I divided the program into several logical files
(AI, UI, utilities and constants). I implemented the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning.
I added unit tests specifically for the AI with >90% coverage. 
I added pylint with 7.96/10 rating and CI.

Next week I'll start properly writing the testing document and probably add more tests.
