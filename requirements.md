- Goal of the project is to create an opponent AI for the traditional Connect Four game
- Used language is Python
- I can peer review also projects written in Java
- Algorithm mainly used is the minimax algorithm, for it is the most efficient algorithm for this purpose
- Target time complexity of the AI is O(n^m) and space complexity O(nm)
- Language used in code, comments and documentation is English
